# sankey-visual-company-income-statement

A small, reusable engine that renders a company's income statement as a polished
Sankey flow diagram — in the style of the NVIDIA "Q1 FY27 Income Statement"
infographic. Green = value retained, red = costs, teal = revenue collection.

Drop in a new company's numbers and you get the same chart.

## Run it

It's a static site for development and local preview. Either:

```bash
# from the project root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

…or just **double-click `index.html`** — d3 and d3-sankey are vendored locally
in `vendor/`, so it works offline as long as the repository files are present.

For a single self-contained HTML file that does not depend on sibling CSS, JS,
font, vendor, data, or reference PNG files, build the standalone artifact:

```bash
pnpm build:standalone
pnpm verify:standalone
```

The generated file is
`output/sankey-visual-company-income-statement.html`. It inlines the viewer CSS,
all ordered scripts, local Montserrat font files, and datasets. It does not
inline or request processed reference PNGs; those remain verification inputs
only.

Pick datasets from the left Company / Data point time navigator, and
use the top **Sankey / Table** switch to choose the view. Sankey mode exports
the current d3-sankey chart as SVG/PNG at 2× resolution. Table mode shows the
company metadata table and the period-level income statement table, with CSV
exports for both.

## Visual loop workflow

Use this workflow when a new reference image is added and the chart needs
another fidelity loop:

1. Put new, unprocessed source PNGs in `input/pending/`.
2. After processing, move the durable reference image to `input/processed/` and
   name it with the dataset key, for example `salesforce-q1-fy27.png`.
3. Set `meta.referenceImage` on the matching dataset to that processed path.
4. If this is a new company, add the company profile to
   `data/company-metadata.js` first: description, sector, industry, headquarters,
   website, ticker/exchange when available, and source URLs.
5. If the source contains company or business/segment icons that need to be
   reproduced, create `input/icon-crop-specs/<dataset-key>.json` and run:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/extract_icon_crops.py --spec input/icon-crop-specs/<dataset-key>.json
   ```

   The spec-driven script writes reusable reference crops to
   `data/assets/icon-references/<company>/crops/`, validation sheets to
   `data/assets/icon-references/<company>/validation-sheets/`, and metrics to
   `crop-report.json`. Review every validation sheet with the original image,
   crop box, and extracted crop visible together, then record the pass/fail
   decision in `model-validation.md`. Extract every semantically relevant
   business cluster unless the task explicitly narrows the scope.
6. Add or update the matching pure-data record in
   `data/income-statements.js`. This file is the comparable financial
   statement SSOT: reported totals, line items, notes, currency and units only,
   with no Sankey layout or render settings.
7. Install the pinned local tooling once:

   ```bash
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   pnpm exec playwright install chromium
   ```

8. Run the deterministic data and d3 checks:

   ```bash
   pnpm verify:ssot
   pnpm verify:d3 -- <dataset-key>
   ```

The verifier starts its own static server, renders a bare d3 SVG for the
dataset, screenshots `#chart > svg`, asserts that no source image or SVG
`<image>` is present, computes pixel metrics against `meta.referenceImage`, and
cleans `compare/`. Use `pnpm verify:d3 -- <dataset-key> --keep` when you need to
inspect the candidate PNG.

`compare/` is a scratch directory. Keep incoming assets in `input/pending/` and
stable app references in `input/processed/`; do not rely on old files in
`compare/` between runs.

For a **d3-sankey fidelity loop**, the rendered output under comparison must be
the SVG produced by `SankeyEngine.render()` / d3-sankey. Do not compare against
Reference mode, a direct `<img>` of the source PNG, or any source-image crop /
raster overlay placed into the d3 output. The source PNG is only the standard to
measure against, never part of the d3-sankey render being scored.

## Icon asset workflow

Icon extraction is intentionally generalized across companies. The reusable
logic lives in `scripts/extract_icon_crops.py`; each source image gets a small
JSON spec in `input/icon-crop-specs/` with only coordinates, filters, output
names, and notes.

Accepted reference assets live under:

```text
data/assets/icon-references/<company>/
  crops/
  validation-sheets/
  crop-report.json
  model-validation.md
```

Use these PNG crops only as references for SVG/vector conversion and reuse
decisions. They must not be embedded in d3 output, standalone artifacts, or
foreground overlays.

## Rendering

The viewer renders only the editable d3-sankey SVG from
`src/sankey-engine.js`. Processed reference PNGs are kept in
`input/processed/` and referenced by `meta.referenceImage` for the fidelity
verifier, but they are not part of the app runtime or standalone HTML artifact.

## Add your company

Create a file in `data/datasets/`, register it on the global `DATASETS` array,
add one `<script>` line in `index.html`, add the comparable financial statement
record to `data/income-statements.js`, and add company-level context to
`data/company-metadata.js` before registering the first dataset for that
company. The fastest Sankey path is the high-level helper — you supply the line
items and it derives every subtotal and flow:

```js
// data/datasets/my-company-fy25.js
(window.DATASETS = window.DATASETS || []).push(
  window.SankeyEngine.fromIncomeStatement({
    key: 'my-company-fy25',
    name: 'My Company · FY25',
    meta: { title: 'My Company FY25 Income Statement',
            period: 'FY2025', currency: '$', unit: 'M', decimals: 0 },

    revenue: [
      { label: 'Product', value: 800, notes: ['+20% Y/Y'] },
      { label: 'Services', value: 200, notes: ['+5% Y/Y'] },
    ],
    costOfRevenue: 300,
    opex: [
      { label: ['Research &', 'Development'], value: 180 },
      { label: ['Sales &', 'Marketing'],     value: 150 },
      { label: ['General &', 'Admin'],        value: 60 },
    ],
    tax: 28,
    otherIncome: [{ label: 'Interest', value: 10 }],   // optional
    derived: {
      grossProfit:     { notes: ['70% margin'] },
      operatingProfit: { notes: ['41% margin'] },
      netProfit:       { notes: ['33% margin'] },
    },
  })
);
```

```html
<!-- index.html, with the other dataset scripts -->
<script src="data/datasets/my-company-fy25.js"></script>
```

That's it. The helper computes Revenue, Gross / Operating / Net profit and wires
all the flows for you. Keep `data/income-statements.js` updated with the same
reported totals and line items, then run `pnpm verify:ssot` to confirm the SSOT
still covers every registered dataset. For pixel-level control over columns,
ordering, icons and label placement, author `nodes` + `links` directly instead — see
[`data/schema.md`](data/schema.md). `data/datasets/nvidia-q1-fy27.js` is a full
hand-authored example; `data/datasets/nvidia-from-figures.js` builds the same chart from
raw figures via the helper.

## How it's built

| file                        | role                                                          |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `index.html`                | static viewer shell and ordered script registration           |
| `src/app.css`               | viewer layout, controls, sidebar, and responsive styles       |
| `src/app.js`                | viewer app logic: navigation, mode switching, resizing, export |
| `src/sankey-engine.js`      | **d3-sankey** renderer: layout + custom nodes/links/labels/logo/interactions |
| `src/income-statement.js`   | `fromIncomeStatement()` — figures → `{nodes, links}`         |
| `src/icons.js`              | Lucide icon set (inline SVG) + the NVIDIA brand glyph         |
| `scripts/build-standalone.mjs` | builds the self-contained HTML artifact                    |
| `scripts/verify-standalone.mjs` | opens the artifact via `file://` and checks d3 rendering |
| `scripts/script-sources.mjs`| shared script classification for page and verifier harnesses  |
| `scripts/extract_icon_crops.py` | spec-driven icon crop extraction and validation           |
| `data/income-statements.js` | pure financial-statement SSOT for totals and line items       |
| `data/company-metadata.js`  | company-profile SSOT for Table mode and onboarding checks     |
| `data/datasets/*.js`      | datasets (one per company/period)                             |
| `data/assets/`              | reusable icon references and validation records               |
| `vendor/`                   | d3 v7 and d3-sankey — vendored for offline use                |

Design choices that keep every chart **aligned and consistent**:

- **Columns are explicit** (`col` per node) so the layout matches the financial
  narrative (segments → revenue → gross → operating → net) instead of whatever
  d3's auto-layering produces.
- **Colour is semantic and automatic** — node colour comes from its `type`;
  link colour is a gradient derived from its endpoints. You never pick a link
  colour by hand.
- **Labels can't collide** — side labels are de-collided in a second pass, so
  even many small terminal nodes (Tax / R&D / SG&A) stay readable.
- **Display values are preserved** — d3-sankey overwrites node values with flow
  sums, so the engine keeps the author's reported figure for the label.

## Notes

- The NVIDIA figures here are **illustrative**, matching the source infographic;
  swap in audited numbers as needed.
- Icons are [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) (MIT). The NVIDIA eye glyph is a brand
  trademark of NVIDIA Corporation, used here only to reproduce the reference;
  swap `meta.logoSvg` for your own asset.
- d3-sankey is ISC licensed and is the only charting renderer vendored here.
