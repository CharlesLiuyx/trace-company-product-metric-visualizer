# Trace (Company & Product Metric Visualizer)

Trace is a small, reusable engine for visualizing company and product metrics.
The current dataset catalog focuses on income statements rendered as polished
Sankey flow diagrams in the style of the NVIDIA "Q1 FY27 Income Statement"
infographic. Green = value retained, red = costs, teal = revenue collection.

Drop in a new company's numbers and you get the same chart.

## Run it

It's a static site for development and local preview. Either:

```bash
# from the project root (zero-dependency static server, no-store caching)
pnpm dev
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

…or just **double-click `index.html`** — d3 and d3-sankey are vendored locally
in `vendor/`, so it works offline as long as the repository files are present.

Before committing, `pnpm check` runs the fast gates (repo-wide JS syntax
sweep, pending-image guard, SSOT parity, i18n coverage, metadata freshness)
in under a second; `pnpm verify:app` boot-and-click smokes the viewer app in
headless Chromium in a few seconds.

For a single self-contained HTML file that does not depend on sibling CSS, JS,
font, vendor, data, or reference PNG files, build the standalone artifact:

```bash
pnpm build:standalone
pnpm verify:standalone
```

The generated file is
`output/trace-company-product-metric-visualizer.html`. It inlines the viewer CSS,
all ordered scripts, local Montserrat font files, and datasets. It does not
inline or request processed reference PNGs; those remain verification inputs
only.

Pick datasets from the left Company / Data point time navigator, and
use the top **Sankey / Table** switch to choose the view. Sankey mode exports
the current d3-sankey chart as SVG/PNG at 2× resolution. Table mode shows the
company metadata table and the period-level income statement table, with CSV
exports for both.

The viewer supports app-wide language switching through `src/i18n.js`. English
data is the canonical verification source, while Sankey and Table mode project
localized display text at runtime. Dataset-specific wording can be refined with
`i18n.<language>` overlays on dataset adapters, financial SSOT records, and
company metadata records.

For fixed-layout Sankey datasets, localizing the node labels is not the same as
localizing the rendered chart text. Any explicit
`layout.labels.*.blocks[].lines[].text`, KPI card text, `annotationsSvg` text,
or other fixed-position SVG copy needs a dataset-level language overlay when it
changes in translation. Acronyms and punctuation-heavy labels such as `R&D`,
`SG&A`, `G&A`, `D&A`, and labels using `&` or money suffixes should be treated
as high-risk strings: either preserve them intentionally or override the exact
localized lines instead of relying on generic phrase replacement.

## Visual loop workflow

Use this workflow when a new reference image is added and the chart needs
another fidelity loop:

1. Put new, unprocessed source PNGs in `input/pending/`.
2. Before processing anything, run the pending guard:

   ```bash
   pnpm check:pending
   ```

   If it reports an exact processed-image match or an existing-key collision,
   stop before moving images, editing data, extracting icons, or running the d3
   loop for that pending image. If you choose a different final dataset key than
   the script's candidate, check that final key against `input/processed/`,
   `data/datasets/`, `data/income-statements/<company-key>.js`, and `index.html` before
   continuing.
3. After processing, move the durable reference image to `input/processed/` and
   name it with the dataset key, for example `salesforce-q1-fy27.png`.
4. Set `meta.referenceImage` on the matching dataset to that processed path.
5. If this is a new company, add the company profile to
   `data/company-metadata/<company-key>.js` first: description, sector, industry, founded
   date, headquarters, fiscal year end, website, ticker/exchange, market cap
   with as-of/source when available, and source URLs.
6. If the source contains company or business/segment icons that need to be
   reproduced, create `input/icon-crop-specs/<dataset-key>.json` and run:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/extract_icon_crops.py --spec input/icon-crop-specs/<dataset-key>.json
   ```

   The spec-driven script writes reusable reference crops to
   `data/assets/icon-references/<company>/crops/`, validation sheets to
   `data/assets/icon-references/<company>/validation-sheets/`, and metrics to
   `crop-report.json`. Review every validation sheet with the original image,
   crop box, and extracted crop visible together, then record the pass/fail
   decision in `model-validation.md`. Extract every semantically relevant
   business cluster unless the task explicitly narrows the scope.
7. Add or update the matching pure-data record in
   `data/income-statements/<company-key>.js`. This file is the comparable financial
   statement SSOT: reported totals, line items, notes, currency and units only,
   with no Sankey layout or render settings.
8. Add localized display text for every non-default language in
   `window.SANKEY_I18N.languageCodes`:
   - `data/datasets/<dataset-key>.js`: `name`, `meta.title`, period labels,
     node labels/notes, and explicit fixed-layout label text.
   - `data/income-statements/<company-key>.js`: financial line-item labels and notes used by
     Table mode.
   - `data/company-metadata/<company-key>.js`: company profile fields when the company is new
     or profile text changes.
   Language overlays may tune text layout such as `titleTextLength`, but should
   not change values, links, node positions, or financial semantics.
   For datasets with fixed `layout.labels`, include localized `layout.labels`
   blocks for every visible text line that should differ from English. Do not
   rely on the global phrase dictionary to translate fixed-position chart text.
   After localization, render the non-default language and inspect the actual
   SVG text bounds for mixed-language leftovers, malformed acronym output,
   overlap, and canvas overflow.
9. Install the pinned local tooling once:

   ```bash
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   pnpm exec playwright install chromium
   ```

10. Run the deterministic data, i18n, and d3 checks:

   ```bash
   pnpm verify:ssot
   pnpm verify:i18n -- --strict <dataset-key>
   pnpm verify:d3 -- <dataset-key>
   ```

   Or run them all (plus syntax, metadata, and a render per language) in one
   go with `pnpm verify:dataset -- <dataset-key>`.

For non-default languages, `verify:i18n --strict` confirms overlay coverage but
does not prove that fixed text fits. For edge-sensitive text such as right-side
`anchor: 'start'` labels, left-side `anchor: 'end'` labels, titles, KPI cards,
and annotations, inspect the localized rendered SVG with `getBBox()` or an
equivalent browser check and make sure text stays within
`meta.referenceImage.width` and `meta.referenceImage.height`.

The verifier starts its own static server, renders a bare d3 SVG for the
dataset, screenshots `#chart > svg`, asserts that no source image or unapproved
SVG `<image>` is present, computes pixel metrics against `meta.referenceImage`,
and cleans `compare/`. Datasets that explicitly set
`render.allowRasterAnnotations` may render approved runtime images from
`data/assets/raster-annotations/`. Use `pnpm verify:d3 -- <dataset-key> --keep`
when you need to inspect the candidate PNG.

`compare/` is a scratch directory. Keep incoming assets in `input/pending/` and
stable app references in `input/processed/`; do not rely on old files in
`compare/` between runs.

For a **d3-sankey fidelity loop**, the rendered output under comparison must be
the SVG produced by `SankeyEngine.render()` / d3-sankey. Do not compare against
Reference mode, a direct `<img>` of the source PNG, or ad hoc source-image crops
or raster overlays placed into the d3 output to cover mismatches. The source PNG
is only the standard to measure against, never part of the d3-sankey render
being scored. The allowed exception is explicit image embedding mode, where
validated semantic icon crops are written to `data/assets/raster-annotations/`
and gated by `render.allowRasterAnnotations`.

## Icon asset workflow

Icon extraction is intentionally generalized across companies. The reusable
logic lives in `scripts/extract_icon_crops.py`; each source image gets a small
JSON spec in `input/icon-crop-specs/` with only coordinates, filters, output
names, and notes.

Accepted reference assets live under:

```text
data/assets/icon-references/<company>/
  crops/
  validation-sheets/
  crop-report.json
  model-validation.md
```

Use these PNG crops only as references for SVG/vector conversion and reuse
decisions. They must not be embedded in d3 output, standalone artifacts, or
foreground overlays.

## Rendering

The viewer renders only the editable d3-sankey SVG from
`src/sankey-engine.js`. Processed reference PNGs are kept in
`input/processed/` and referenced by `meta.referenceImage` for the fidelity
verifier, but they are not part of the app runtime or standalone HTML artifact.

## Add your company

Create a file in `data/datasets/`, register it on the global `DATASETS` array,
add one `<script>` line in `index.html`, add the comparable financial statement
record to `data/income-statements/<company-key>.js`, and add company-level context to
`data/company-metadata/<company-key>.js` before registering the first dataset for that
company. Registered datasets are authored as high-fidelity adapters: define the
node/link graph explicitly, then tune `layout.nodes` and `layout.labels` against
the processed reference image.

```js
// data/datasets/my-company-fy25.js
const dataset = {
  key: 'my-company-fy25',
  name: 'My Company · FY25',
  meta: {
    title: 'My Company FY25 Income Statement',
    period: 'FY2025',
    currency: '$',
    unit: 'M',
    decimals: 0,
    referenceImage: {
      src: 'input/processed/my-company-fy25.png',
      width: 2862,
      height: 1536,
    },
  },
  nodes: [
    { id: 'product', label: 'Product', value: 800, type: 'revenue' },
    { id: 'services', label: 'Services', value: 200, type: 'revenue' },
    { id: 'revenue', label: 'Revenue', value: 1000, type: 'total' },
    { id: 'cost_of_revenue', label: 'Cost of revenue', value: 300, type: 'cost' },
    { id: 'gross_profit', label: 'Gross profit', value: 700, type: 'profit' },
  ],
  links: [
    { source: 'product', target: 'revenue', value: 800 },
    { source: 'services', target: 'revenue', value: 200 },
    { source: 'revenue', target: 'gross_profit', value: 700 },
    { source: 'revenue', target: 'cost_of_revenue', value: 300 },
  ],
  layout: {
    nodes: {
      product: { x: 120, y: 280, width: 80, height: 240 },
      services: { x: 120, y: 640, width: 80, height: 120 },
      revenue: { x: 760, y: 390, width: 80, height: 360 },
      gross_profit: { x: 1380, y: 330, width: 80, height: 260 },
      cost_of_revenue: { x: 1380, y: 760, width: 80, height: 100 },
    },
    labels: {
      product: {
        blocks: [{ x: 88, top: 300, anchor: 'end', lines: [{ text: 'Product' }, { text: '$800M' }] }],
      },
      services: {
        blocks: [{ x: 88, top: 660, anchor: 'end', lines: [{ text: 'Services' }, { text: '$200M' }] }],
      },
      revenue: {
        blocks: [{ x: 800, top: 320, anchor: 'middle', lines: [{ text: 'Revenue' }, { text: '$1.0B' }] }],
      },
    },
  },
};

(window.DATASETS = window.DATASETS || []).push(dataset);
```

```html
<!-- index.html, with the other dataset scripts -->
<script src="data/datasets/my-company-fy25.js"></script>
```

Keep `data/income-statements/<company-key>.js` updated with the same reported totals and line
items, then run `pnpm verify:ssot` to confirm the SSOT still covers every
registered dataset. See [`data/schema.md`](data/schema.md) for the full
low-level format. `data/datasets/nvidia-q1-fy27.js` is a compact hand-authored
example.

Design choices that keep every chart **aligned and consistent**:

- **Columns are explicit** (`col` per node) so the layout matches the financial
  narrative (segments → revenue → gross → operating → net) instead of whatever
  d3's auto-layering produces.
- **Colour is semantic and automatic** — node colour comes from its `type`;
  link colour is a gradient derived from its endpoints. You never pick a link
  colour by hand.
- **Labels can't collide** — side labels are de-collided in a second pass, so
  even many small terminal nodes (Tax / R&D / SG&A) stay readable.
- **Display values are preserved** — d3-sankey overwrites node values with flow
  sums, so the engine keeps the author's reported figure for the label.

## Notes

- The NVIDIA figures here are **illustrative**, matching the source infographic;
  swap in audited numbers as needed.
- Icons are [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) (MIT). The NVIDIA eye glyph is a brand
  trademark of NVIDIA Corporation, used here only to reproduce the reference;
  swap `meta.logoSvg` for your own asset.
- d3-sankey is ISC licensed and is the only charting renderer vendored here.
