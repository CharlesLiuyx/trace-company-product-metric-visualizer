# Data Directory

The `data/` directory is the source of truth for dataset records and reusable
data-adjacent assets.

```text
data/
  README.md
  schema.md
  income-statements.js     # pure financial-statement SSOT
  company-metadata.js      # company profile SSOT
  datasets/
    <dataset-key>.js       # registered Sankey dataset adapters
  assets/
    icon-references/       # reusable icon reference crops and validation
```

Keep registered dataset adapters at `data/datasets/<dataset-key>.js`. The viewer,
standalone builder, and verification scripts load these files directly from
`index.html`, and the project workflow documents this path as the stable
dataset convention.

Use `data/assets/icon-references/<company>/` for reusable company and business
icon reference crops. These crops are conversion references only; d3 output must
use SVG/vector assets and must not embed these PNG crops.

For each company icon-reference folder, keep this shape:

```text
data/assets/icon-references/<company>/
  crops/
  validation-sheets/
  crop-report.json
  model-validation.md
```

The crop spec that regenerates these files belongs in
`input/icon-crop-specs/<dataset-key>.json`.
