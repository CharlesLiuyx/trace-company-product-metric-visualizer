# AGENTS.md

Guidance for agents working in this repository.

## Goal

This project turns income-statement reference images into reusable Sankey
datasets and reusable icon/vector assets. When `input/pending/` contains new
source PNGs, process them into stable datasets, extract validated icon
reference assets when needed, and run the d3-sankey fidelity loop (manual
rounds; see `docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md`).

## Trace Architecture Boundaries

- `docs/trace-specification.zh-CN.md` is the top-level Trace product/model spec.
- Keep Trace domain normalization in `src/trace-domain.js`; keep `src/app.js`
  focused on UI state, interaction, tables, and view switching.
- `data/income-statements.js` (income-statement family) and
  `data/revenue-metrics.js` (revenue family) are the pure Metric SSOTs;
  `data/datasets/<dataset-key>.js` is the Sankey View Adapter layer. Both SSOTs
  are enforced by `verify:ssot` and, in strict mode, `verify:i18n`. Keep Sankey
  geometry out of both.
- `data/products.js` is a placeholder for a future first-class Product SSOT
  (currently empty, not verifier-checked). Do not hide Product identity or
  ownership history inside Sankey adapters.
- When adding a metric family or SSOT, backfill this file and
  `docs/trace-specification.zh-CN.md`.

## Commands

Install once; `verify:d3` and `verify:standalone` render in Chromium:

    pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm exec playwright install chromium

| command | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm check:pending` | pending-image duplicate / key-collision guard |
| `pnpm verify:ssot` | income + revenue SSOT ↔ dataset parity (global) |
| `pnpm verify:i18n -- --strict <key>` | i18n overlay coverage for a dataset |
| `pnpm verify:d3 -- <key> [--focus <dir>] [--keep] [--language <code>]` | d3 render + auto hard gates; loop per `docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md` |
| `pnpm verify:dataset-file-metadata` | `data/dataset-file-metadata.js` is current |
| `pnpm build:standalone` + `pnpm verify:standalone` | build and check the self-contained HTML |

`build:standalone` regenerates `data/dataset-file-metadata.js` first. Manual d3
rounds archive to `output/compare/<key>/...`; scratch `compare/` is cleaned by
`sh scripts/clean-compare.sh`.

## Input Workflow

1. Inspect `input/pending/` and ignore `.gitkeep`.
2. Before moving images or updating data, check whether each pending PNG has
   already been processed:
   - Run `pnpm check:pending`, or manually compare the pending PNG against
     `input/processed/` by content and candidate dataset key.
   - Treat exact matches in `input/processed/` and candidate-key collisions as
     stop conditions. Do not move, overwrite, create, update, crop, vectorize,
     or verify anything for that pending image; report the duplicate or
     collision instead.
   - If the final stable dataset key differs from the script's candidate key,
     check that final key against `input/processed/`, `data/datasets/`,
     `data/income-statements.js`, and `index.html` before continuing.
3. For each new pending PNG, choose a stable dataset key:
   - Lowercase kebab case.
   - Include company and period, for example `nvidia-q4-fy26`.
4. Move the durable source image to:
   - `input/processed/<dataset-key>.png`
5. Create or update:
   - `data/datasets/<dataset-key>.js`
   - `data/income-statements.js`
   - `data/company-metadata.js` when the company is new
   - `index.html` dataset script registration
   - Dataset, SSOT, and company metadata i18n overlays for every non-default
     language listed in `window.SANKEY_I18N.languageCodes`
6. If company icons or company-internal business/segment icons appear in the
   source image, run the spec-driven icon extraction workflow before
   vectorizing or rendering them:
   - Create or update `input/icon-crop-specs/<dataset-key>.json`.
   - Use `scripts/extract_icon_crops.py` to write validated reference crops to
     `data/assets/icon-references/<company>/crops/`.
   - The crop script removes solid crop-background pixels and writes
     transparent PNGs by default. Tune `backgroundRemoval` in the spec only
     when a crop needs a different tolerance, all-matching removal, or an
     opaque output.
   - Write validation sheets to
     `data/assets/icon-references/<company>/validation-sheets/`.
   - Keep `crop-report.json` and `model-validation.md` in the company asset
     folder.
   - Extract every semantically relevant company and business/segment icon
     cluster in the source image unless the user explicitly limits the scope.
     Do not stop after one sample cluster when the image contains multiple
     business clusters.
   - Exclude source publisher watermarks, creator/account branding, website
     URLs, social badges, "how they make money" marks, attribution blocks, and
     any segment such as "Others" that has no independent business icon.
   Validate each crop before vectorizing it:
   - The icon's main structure is fully included.
   - The main structure is visually centered in the crop.
   - No unrelated text, chart marks, connector fragments, watermarks, or
     neighboring icon parts are included.
   Re-crop until those checks pass. The files under
   `data/assets/icon-references/<company>/crops/` are reference/conversion
   assets only and must not be referenced directly from d3 runtime output.
   When image embedding mode is explicitly used, set `runtimeOutputDir` in the
   crop spec so the accepted crops are written as compressed runtime copies
   under `data/assets/raster-annotations/<company>/`.
7. Before authoring a new company's first dataset, gather company metadata
   (description, sector, industry, founded date, headquarters, fiscal year end,
   website, ticker/exchange, market cap with as-of/source when available, and
   source URLs) and add it to `data/company-metadata.js`.
   Also add localized company profile fields for every non-default supported
   language, including at least display name when it differs, sector, industry,
   headquarters, fiscal year end, and description.
8. Set `meta.referenceImage` to the processed PNG with exact source dimensions.
9. Keep `input/pending/` empty except `.gitkeep` after processing.

## Dataset Authoring

Prefer the existing project patterns; see `data/schema.md` for the full
low-level dataset format:

- Author registered datasets as high-fidelity adapters with explicit low-level
  `nodes`, `links`, `layout.nodes`, and `layout.labels` tuned against the source
  image.
- When first identifying label regions in a source image, keep each semantic
  label unit intact. Do not split a node's related name, value, notes, margin,
  or Y/Y text into unrelated regions just because they are visually separated;
  group them under the same node/label intent first, then split into
  `layout.labels.*.blocks` or line breaks for placement.
- Preserve values and notes from the source image.
- Do not reproduce source publisher watermarks, creator/account branding,
  website URLs, social badges, "how they make money" marks, or other attribution
  blocks that are unrelated to the company income-statement semantics. Treat
  them as intentional skipped residuals in the fidelity loop, not render targets.
- Keep costs as positive numbers; the renderer formats `type: 'cost'` as
  parenthesized values.
- Register new datasets after dependencies and after any dataset they reuse.
- Keep `data/income-statements.js` as the pure financial-statement SSOT for
  every registered real dataset. It should contain comparable reported totals,
  line items, notes, currency, unit, period, and source image only. Do not put
  Sankey `nodes`, `links`, `layout`, `render`, SVG, colors, or pixel geometry
  in the SSOT.
- Keep `data/company-metadata.js` as the company-profile SSOT. It powers the
  Table view's company list and should be updated before the first dataset for
  a new company is registered.
- Keep English as the canonical/default data language. For Sankey and Table
  i18n, add `i18n.<language>` overlays instead of creating parallel dataset
  files. These overlays may contain localized display strings and language-
  specific text layout adjustments, but must not change values, links, node
  geometry, financial totals, source images, or verification semantics.
- When authoring or materially changing a dataset, localize all user-visible
  dataset text for every non-default supported language: `name`, `meta.title`,
  `meta.period`, `meta.periodNote`, node labels, notes, and any explicit
  `layout.labels.*.blocks[].lines[].text` that is not `$value`. Localize the
  matching income-statement/revenue SSOT labels/notes and new company metadata
  as part of the same workflow.
- Do not rely on the global i18n phrase dictionary for fixed-position chart
  text. If a dataset uses explicit `layout.labels`, `annotationsSvg`, KPI
  cards, or other SVG text fragments, add dataset-specific
  `i18n.<language>.layout.labels` or localized annotation overrides for every
  visible line that changes in translation. Translating `nodes[].label` alone
  is not enough when fixed layout text is present.
- Treat acronyms, ampersands, punctuation-heavy labels, and labels with money
  suffixes as high-risk i18n text. Examples include `R&D`, `SG&A`,
  `G&A`, `D&A`, `Online Marketing & Others`, and
  `Sales & marketing ($3.1B)`. Preserve approved acronyms or provide explicit
  localized lines; do not let generic punctuation cleanup split them into
  malformed text.
- For non-default language layout tuning, check rendered SVG text bounds, not
  just source coordinates. In particular, right-side `anchor: 'start'` labels,
  left-side `anchor: 'end'` labels, titles, KPI cards, and annotations must
  remain inside `meta.referenceImage.width` and `meta.referenceImage.height`
  after localization. Prefer line breaks, local x/y adjustments, or local font
  sizing over changing values, links, node geometry, or financial semantics.

For company and business icons:

- Treat company icons and company-internal business/segment illustrative icons
  as reusable assets. Prefer vector assets when the icon can be represented
  cleanly, but image embedding mode is allowed for validated company/business
  icon clusters when the source contains brand-specific bitmap detail or the
  user asks for image embedding.
- When adding icons for the first time, first crop every relevant source region
  as original-icon reference assets through `scripts/extract_icon_crops.py`.
  The script must be driven by a dataset-specific JSON spec so the workflow
  stays reusable across companies. The script should remove the solid crop
  background and emit a transparent PNG after cropping. Use each crop only after
  checking that the icon subject is complete, centered, and free of unrelated
  surrounding content. Then either convert it to SVG/vector geometry for reuse,
  or, in image embedding mode, write a separate runtime copy through
  `runtimeOutputDir`.
- For visual/model crop validation, use the generated validation sheet for each
  crop. It contains the original source image, the highlighted crop box, and
  the extracted crop. Record acceptance in
  `data/assets/icon-references/<company>/model-validation.md`.
- When vectorizing icons, load `docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md` and follow its
  SVG/vector icon subloop.
- For later datasets, reuse existing SVG/vector icons whenever the source icon
  is materially similar. Adjust the existing SVG viewBox, transform, size,
  placement, or styling instead of creating near-duplicate assets.
- Use Lucide/vector icons from `src/icons.js` for generic semantic icons when
  they match the source intent.
- In image embedding mode, load `docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md` for the runtime
  raster exception rules and `data/assets/README.md` for asset layout.
- Set `meta.logoSvg` to a vector company logo when the source shows one.

## Data and Asset Layout

Keep registered dataset adapters at `data/datasets/<dataset-key>.js`. The viewer,
standalone builder, SSOT verifier, and project docs rely on this stable path.

Use `data/assets/` for reusable data-adjacent assets:

```text
data/assets/
  icon-references/
    <company>/
      crops/              # validated icon reference crops
      validation-sheets/  # original image + crop-box review sheets
      crop-report.json    # script output and validation metrics
      model-validation.md # model/visual acceptance record
  raster-annotations/
    <company>/            # compressed runtime raster annotations
```

Reference crops in `data/assets/icon-references/` are not runtime assets. They
exist to support SVG/vector conversion and future reuse decisions only.
Runtime raster annotation rules are defined in `docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md`.

## d3-Sankey Fidelity Loop

Before running or reporting any d3-Sankey fidelity loop, load and follow
`docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md`. That file is the SSOT for d3 output purity,
allowed changes, image/raster exceptions, metrics, iteration, localization
layout checks, temporary `compare/` handling, user-feedback learning, red-box
attention reference images, Task information, final Loop Fidelity Summary, and
icon SVG/vector subloops.

When a user points out a fidelity issue, treat it as a process-improvement
signal as well as a local fix. Follow `docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md` to either
generalize the lesson back into the rules or record the dataset-specific
exception in the loop Task information. Each manual loop round must maintain
the current Task information and, when there are open attention areas, produce
the required red-box reference image for the next round.

If `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, or another project note differs from
`docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md` on fidelity-loop behavior, follow
`docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md`.

## Hard Rules

- When a shareable final HTML artifact is requested, produce the standalone
  file with `pnpm build:standalone`. The artifact must be self-contained: no
  sibling CSS, JS, font, vendor, data, or reference PNG files should be needed
  at runtime.
- Do not rename processed images after assigning a stable dataset key.

## Commit Message Convention

Follow the project convention in `docs/commit-messages.md`. Use the lightweight
Conventional Commits shape:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <summary>
```

Use an English, lowercase summary with no trailing period. Keep the first line
focused on one purpose, and put verification details in the body when useful.

Preferred project types:

- `data` for dataset files, processed input images, and `index.html` dataset
  registration.
- `render` for `src/sankey-engine.js` and visible SVG/rendering behavior.
- `verify` for `scripts/verify-d3.mjs` and d3 fidelity checks.
- `schema` for dataset format conventions.
- `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, or `chore` for ordinary changes.

Prefer scopes such as a dataset key (`nvidia-q1-fy27`), module (`engine`,
`icons`, `verify-d3`), or workflow area (`input`, `export`, `d3-mode`). For
new dataset work, keep the processed PNG, `data/datasets/<dataset-key>.js`, and
`index.html` registration in the same `data(<dataset-key>)` commit. If a
dataset requires reusable renderer support, split that into a separate
`render(engine)` commit before the dataset tuning commit.

## Verification Checklist

Commands are defined in [Commands](#commands). Always, before final response:

- `node --check` passes on every JS file you changed (datasets, both SSOTs,
  `data/company-metadata.js`, `src/*`, generated metadata).
- `pnpm verify:ssot` passes.
- `input/pending/` contains only `.gitkeep`, or a stop condition is reported.

For a new or materially changed dataset, also:

- Processed image at `input/processed/<dataset-key>.png`; script registered in
  `index.html`.
- `pnpm verify:i18n -- --strict <dataset-key>` passes after language overlays
  are added.
- `pnpm verify:d3 -- <dataset-key>` passes its hard gates; when a fidelity loop
  is required, run it per `docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md` with current Task
  information, a red-box reference image or closure note, and user-feedback
  lessons folded back into the rules or recorded as a dataset exception.
- Per non-default language, inspect the rendered localized SVG (`getBBox()` or
  equivalent) for mixed-language leftovers, malformed acronym/punctuation,
  overlap, and out-of-canvas bounds; `verify:i18n --strict` does not prove
  fixed-layout text is valid.
- `pnpm verify:dataset-file-metadata` passes (refresh with
  `pnpm update:dataset-file-metadata` if stale).

If icon assets were extracted:

- `python3 scripts/extract_icon_crops.py --spec input/icon-crop-specs/<dataset-key>.json` passes.
- `crop-report.json` shows every crop `passes: true`; validation sheets reviewed;
  `model-validation.md` records acceptance.
- Every relevant company/business cluster is extracted or documented as skipped.
- For image embedding mode, the runtime raster checks in
  `docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md` pass.

If a standalone artifact is required, `pnpm build:standalone` then
`pnpm verify:standalone` pass.

## Reporting

In the final response, include:

- Files changed.
- Whether the pure data SSOT was updated.
- Which icon assets were extracted, and whether all relevant business clusters
  were accounted for.
- For dataset or renderer changes, the final d3 loop result required by
  `docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md`, including the compact Loop Fidelity Summary,
  latest Task information, and red-box reference image status when a fidelity
  loop was run. If no loop was run, state why.
- Whether user-feedback lessons changed `docs/fidelity-loop-rules.md` or were
  recorded as dataset-specific exceptions.
- Any commands that could not be run.
